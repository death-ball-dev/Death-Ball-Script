![Death Ball Script](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/645fcbb8-dc72-45c3-b564-092fc2c11518)

The script is typically executed using a Roblox script executor. After injecting the script into the game, players can toggle features via a GUI (graphical user interface) or keybinds. Most scripts run Lua code that interacts with the game‚Äôs internal events or modifies values directly in memory.
